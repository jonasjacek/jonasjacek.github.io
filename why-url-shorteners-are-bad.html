        <h1>Why URL shortening services and shortURLs are bad</h1>
        <h2>Small so called &quot;shortURLs&quot;, generated by free URL shortening services, are all over the Internet. Learn how they attack your privacy, security and the functionality of the Web in general.</h2>
        <p>TinyURL.com, cli.gs, goo.gl, tr.im, bit.ly and most recently gadaf.fi (not a lybian URL shortener). We all know URI shortening or URLshortening their links are all over the Internet. We use them and maybe not even think about them although they serve incredible amounts of users. In November 2009, the shortened links on one URL shortening service were accessed 2.1 billion times. Calculate them all together and add some traffic gains for microblogging services and you can (maybe not) imagine where we are today.</p>
        <h3>A Man-Made Problem: Why ShortURLs exist</h3>
        <p>The concept and idea behind URL shortening exists mainly because humanity lacks the ability to <a href="/how-to/url-design">design short, user-centered URLs (clean URL Design)</a>. Sometimes there are technical reasons, sometimes there are simply brain-amputed web developers and project managers not giving a fuck.</p>
        <p>Since the time when badly designed URLs - which usually contain special characters - broke in email communication, <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> channels, forum posts or web design, the concept became popular.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, shortened URLs are especially convenient for microblogging technologies such as the open platform StatusNet (Identi.ca) and the proprietary platform Twitter, which severely limit the number of characters that may be used in a message (Twitter limits its messages to 140 characters).</p>
        <p>Microblogging mimics the concept of <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> with the idea to reduce communication to only important or relevant information (arguable, of course). Short URLs allow otherwise long web addresses to be referred to in a dent (Identi.ca) or tweet (Twitter).</p>
        <p>As we keep on developing web sites which serve badly designed URLs (old-school) and invent new ways to communicate on the Internet (e.g. Microblogging) we are forced to find ways to bring old-school programming and new-school communication together. One of the results is the existence of URL shortening services.</p>

        <h3>How URL Shorteners work</h3>
        <p>URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> may be made substantially shorter in length and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using an HTTP Redirect on a domain name that is short, which links to the web page that has a long URL.</p>

        <h3>What is the Problem with URL Shortening Services?</h3>
        <p>The convenience offered by URL shortening services introduces potential and real problems, which I want to outline below.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Additional Layer of complexity</strong> - First and foremost, shortURLs add an unnecessary layer to the way the internet works. There should be no reason to generate a URL for an existing URL.<br />This has plenty of disadvantages. Through URL shortening, every access requires more requests (at least one more DNS lookup and HTTP request), thereby increasing latency, the time taken to access the page and also the risk of failure, since the shortening service may become unavailable. ...not to speak about the energy costs generated by these extra requests. Save energy, stop using shortURLs!</li>
        <li><strong>Linkrot</strong> - Linkrot refers to the problem of rotting links in case the URL shortening service stops working. In this case all URLs related to the service will become broken. This happens quite often, do not be fooled by big names.</li>
        <li><strong>Hidden Target Address</strong> - Short URL obscure the target address. This means you do not know where the short URL leads you to. Many spammers and scammers have used short URL to trick users. Kickme.to/banking-login does not necessarily lead you to your banking account login.</li>
        <li><strong>Traffic Highjacking</strong> - Some URL shortening services highjack traffic (traffic theft). Imagine every third or fourth redirect gets a different target address or additional redirects. If you run a URL shortener yourself this is great. You can build traffic for your own web sites, serve drive-by-downloads of cookies (cookie stuffing for affiliate marketing) or trojan horses and viruses to users. The possibilities of misuse are vast.</li>
        <li><strong>Short URL Blocking</strong> - Some websites prevent short, redirected URLs from being posted. In 2006, MySpace banned posting TinyURLs and Facebook, in July 2010, blocked TinyURL and Bit.ly links, as part of what it called a &quot;temporary spam prevention measure." TinyURL was reported to be blocked in Saudi Arabia and by Yahoo! Answers. Wikipedia and Craigslist also do not accept shortened URLs.</li>
        <li><strong>International Laws</strong> - Shortened internet links typically use foreign country domain names, and are therefore under the jurisdiction of that nation. Libya, for instance, exercised its control over the .ly domain in October 2010 to shut down vb.ly for violating Libyan pornography laws. Failure to predict such problems with URL shorteners and investment in URL shortening companies may reflect a lack of due diligence.</li>
        <li><strong>Irrelevant Looking</strong> - Some services do not allow to define a keyword for your shortURL, or the keyword you want is already taken, in these cases your shortURL looks meaningless, unattractive and irrelevant. Where do you think a click on http://tr.im/30l9 is taking you?</li>
        <li><strong>Bad for SEO</strong> - If you are an Internet marketer, you should not use free URLshortening services at all. Using them will expose your users to unnecessary risks, you won't build a brand and you will not get good links to your website, they ruin your statistics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Countermeasures - Make Your Own Short URLs</h3>
        <p>If you really have to use shortURLs, generate them on your own domain, from your own server with your own specifications regarding to the redirect type (<a href="http://web.standards.consulting/http-status-codes#3xx">Redirection Server Header Status Codes</a>), custom keywords and link target previews. If you do it right, you can cut the disadvantages listed above to a minimum. So, get yourself a nice, short sub domain for your domain like x.example.com/shortURL.</p>
