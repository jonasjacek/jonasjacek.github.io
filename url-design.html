        <h1>Clean URL Design - Best Practices</h1>
        <h2>Learn how to design your URIs and URLs so they are short, beautiful, meaningful, user-centered, search engine friendly (SEO) and hackable. Avoid common mistakes with these information architecture &amp; URL design best practices.</h2>
        <p>Designing great <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr> is crucial for information architecture on the World Wide Web, search engine optimization and usability. If your URLs are badly designed you will run into problems in all of these areas. For example, your web site will get non-canonical backlinks, it will not rank well in search engines and users may not be able to read and understand your URLs. Let me help you understand what great URL design is and what it takes to design short, beautiful, meaningful, user-centered, search engine friendly and hackable URLs.</p>
        <p><b>Please be aware:</b> In popular usage &quot;<strong>URL</strong>&quot; is often incorrectly used as a synonym for <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier"><strong>URI</strong></abbr>. For the sake of search engine friendliness and findability, I have used both terms interchangeably in this article, although it should be URI.</p>
        <h3>URL Basics - Definition of an URL</h3>
        <p>URLs are the foundation of hypertext for the World-Wide Web. A URL is a URI and specifies the resource that a link &quot;points to.&quot; It tells you everything you need to know about the resource in order to get to it as a URL specifies where a known resource is available and the mechanism for retrieving it. This means, URLs can consist of few to many different - more or less meaningful - parts.</p>
        <h3>Why URL Design is Important</h3>
        <p>Apart from the official definition of an URI or URL, there is an unwritten yet very important agreement in each and every URL between you (as the webmaster) and your users. Kyle Neath of warpspire.com has put his explanation of this agreement in two beautiful sentences:</p>
        <cite>Kyle Neath</cite>
        <blockquote cite="http://warpspire.com/posts/url-design/">A URL is an agreement to serve something from a predictable location for as long as possible. Once your first visitor hits a URL you've implicitly entered into an agreement that if they bookmark the page or hit refresh, they'll see the same thing.</blockquote>
        <p>...or in the words of Sir Timothy John &quot;Tim&quot; Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web: &quot;Cool URIs don't change&quot;.</p>
        <p>While HTML and CSS make it incredibly easy to redesign the look &amp;feel of a web site, it's much more difficult to redesign the URL structure. Actually, it is something you should not do, because of the agreement between you and your web site users. If you have to change the URL structure (for example to optimize it after reading this post) you have to make sure to redirect all requests on your old URLs to the new URLs, using a permanent redirect (<a href="http://web.standards.consulting/http-status-codes#3xx">Server Header Status Code 301</a>).</p>
        <h3>Classic URL Structure - http URI scheme</h3>
        <p>The http URI scheme (classic URL / URI structure) is defined by the <abbr title="Internet standard">STD</abbr> 66 and the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986"><abbr title="Request for Comments">RFC</abbr> 3986</a> by the <abbr title="The Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</abbr>. The generic syntax, other official IANA-registered schemes and unofficial but common URI schemes can be found on wikipedia's page on <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/URI_scheme">URI schemes</a>.</p>
        <p>For this article I took a slightly different approach with a slightly different, yet common, naming convention:</p>
        <p>Let's have a look at an example for a user page on example.com, to learn more about the different building blocks of URLs:<br />
        http://www.example.com:80/users/location/username.php#bio?sid=123</p>
        <pre><code><strong>[protocol]</strong><br />http://<br /><strong>[prefix]</strong><br />www.<br /><strong>[sub domain]</strong><br />example.<br /><strong>[<abbr title="Top Level Domain">TLD</abbr>]</strong><br />com<br /><strong>[port number]</strong><br />:80/<br /><strong>[directory]</strong><br />users/location/<br /><strong>[resource id]</strong><br />username<br /><strong>[resource extension]</strong><br />.php<br /><strong>[anchor]</strong><br />#bio<br /><strong>[parameters]</strong><br />?name=username&amp;place=location<br /><strong>[session id]</strong><br />?sid=123</code></pre>
        <p>Even for my short and simple example above, you can see that a URL can reach a considerable length. It can become quite complicated in structure, even if the individual elements are clear and understandable.</p>
        <p>Let me mess up my example a little more ...using a real-world domain name and session id, adding more parameters, changing names and parameters from words to numbers, etc. This is the perfect example for an not user-friendly, meaning-less and long URL:</p>
        <p>https://www.my-cool-website.com:8080/users/6784309/966545678.php<br />?name=966545678&amp;place=6784309&amp;sid=12876764356367533452465745863</p>
        <p>With plenty of free forum scripts, content management systems (they love to violate the rules of great URL design), plugins for tracking, etc. out there for every beginner to URL design, this is the online world we live in right now. This kind of URL brakes in email communication, <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> channels, forum posts and has the potential to break many (equally poor) web designs.</p>
        <h3>Why Not Just bit.ly the Beast?</h3>
        <p>Humanity came up with the concept of URL shortening to fix the symptoms of badly designed URLs. However, URL shorteners do not solve the problem, they make it even worse. They help you to break the agreement with your users. If you find the time, read my article on <a href="/why-url-shorteners-are-bad">why URL shorteners are bad</a>.</p>
        <h3>Common Causes of Bad URL Design</h3>
        <p>URL design is no rocket science but it helps to understand and identify possible causes of bad URL design problems. The following is a list of the most common causes of bad URL design, I came across when working for clients. All these issues are usually easily avoidable through rewriting and the use of cookies.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>WWW prefix</b><br />The www-prefix can be avoided, if there are no technical (or historical) reasons for keeping it.</li>
          <li><b>Port-Numbers</b><br />Port numbers in http URLs have become rare lately, yet there are still some websites using them. Try to avoid them by configuring your server to serve web site pages at port 80 (http default) and keep it out of your URL.</li>
          <li><b>Bad or No Rewriting</b><br />Showing file extensions (.html, .php, etc.) and folders like /scipts/ or /cgi-bin/ is not necessary. In contrary, this may trigger hacking attempts. Use rewriting to hide irrelevant information in your URLs from your users and search engines.</li>
          <li><b>Non-ASCII Characters</b><br />Non-ASCII characters can be devastating for the accessibility and usability of a URI. Non-english web sites - of course - are free to use their own character sets in so called <abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifiers">IRIs</abbr>. See this document on <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/">Internationalized Resource Identifiers</a> for more information: <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987"><abbr title="The Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</abbr> <abbr title="Request for Comments">RFC</abbr> 3987</a>.</li>
          <li><b>Search for Navigation</b><br />Using search as an integral part of navigation is simply a complete no-go. For form requests, parameters are absolutely fine but they should never go into the regular URL design.</li>
          <li><b>Additive Filtering / Faceted Navigation</b><br />Multiple filtering or faceted navigation for a set of fixed items. This usually adds one or more parameters to URLs, serving only slightly different content.</li>
          <li><b>Different Views</b><br />Many web sites offer different views for users. Think about list view, icon view, sorting parameters, etc.</li>
          <li><b>Irrelevant Parameters</b><br />Irrelevant parameters are usually added to your URL, when you are dealing with, visitor counters, timestamps or advertisements. Think about referrer ID's, thread ID's, session ID's, etc.</li>
          <li><b>Calendar Issues</b><br />Calendars are usually infinite. If you put calendar parameters in your URL, they will mess them up. You do not want an infinite number of URLs pointing to one single resource.</li>
          <li><b>Broken Relative Links</b><br />When you are changing your web site structure, you should watch out for broken relative links. This kind of problem is an absolute classic.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Rules of Thumb for Clean, Well Designed URLs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Leading Slashes and Trailing Slashes</strong><br />This is easy: Directories should always have a trailing slash. This is convention, I recommend it. HTML files never have a trailing slash. Your http://example.com/ should always have a trailing slash as it represents your web root which equals a directory.</li>
          <li><strong>DirectoryIndex Files</strong><br />Make sure to define your directory index files in your server settings so they do not need to be displayed.</li>
          <li><strong>Structural Depth</strong><br />Make sure to keep your web site structure flat. Two to three levels for small web sites and three to four levels for larger web sites is the deepest I would go. Please keep in mind: Search Engines rarely rank files deeply hidden in your directory structure for high competitive keywords.</li>
          <li><strong>Filenames</strong><br />Keep your filenames short and descriptive. Do not overdo the <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>, it is also difficult for users to read long <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Slug_%28web_publishing%29" title="Explanation of URL Slug">URL slugs</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Filename Extensions</strong><br />Filenames should not have extensions. There is no real need to display .html, .php, .asp, etc. in your URI. Exceptions to the rule: Image, Video, Music and similar files should have an extension.</li>
          <li><strong>Readable</strong><br />Make your URLs readable for humans instead of using long ID numbers.</li>
          <li><strong>Punctuation</strong><br />Split up words with hyphens. Always prefer to use hyphens (-) instead of underscores (_), dots (.) or other punctuation.</li>
          <li><strong>URLs Are For Humans</strong><br />URIs are made for humans, not for search engines. Let us keep it that way and leave SEO-keyword spam (multiple keywords in URLs) out of URLs, it does not help you rank anyway.</li>
          <li><strong>Simplicity</strong><br />Try to design your URL slug as simple as possible. Stay away from rare characters to help humans and Search Engines to understand your URLs.</li>
          <li><strong>Short and Sexy</strong><br />Whenever possible, shorten URLs by trimming unnecessary parameters, filename extensions, software mechanisms (e.g. scripts), session ID's, etc. Short and clean URI's are more easy to type and to remember (usability).</li>
          <li><strong>URL Structure Changes</strong><br />Keep changes to your URL structure to a minimum. If you must change anything make sure to use permanent redirects from old to the new locations. However, the coolest URIs do not change, ever.</li>
          <li><strong>Content</strong><br />Make sure your URLs always point to the same content. This is difficult, for example when it comes to paging and blogs and is the reason why permalinks were invented. However, try to keep changing contents for a specific URL at a minimum.</li>
          <li><strong>Hackablity</strong><br />Always make sure your URLs are hackable and make sense to humans. Ideally a user can guess what to change to get to another page. This includes another rule: E.g. every part of the path has to exist. If example.com/about/idea exists, example.com/about/ must exist as well. Think about the command line.</li>
          <li><strong>Broken Links</strong><br />Check for broken links on a regular basis. There are some free tools you can use: For cross-platform online checks I can recommend the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/checklink">W3C Online Linkchecker</a>. For software fanatics I can recommend <em>gURLchecker</em> and <em>LinkChecker</em> for (Linux) and <em>Xenu Link Sleuth</em> for (Windows).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Further Readings</h3>
        <p>There are plenty of great articles on URI design and clean URI's from other sources. To name a few names - Jakob Nielsen, Mark Pilgrim, Matthew Thomas, Simon Willison, Jesse James Garrett, M&aacute;r Örlygsson, Brent Simmons, Adam DuVander, Adam Moran, Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman, Mike Schinkel, Peter Seebach, Thomas Powell and Joe Lima - they all wrote great articles on their insights of desirable URI design. However, they basically just repeat the preaches of Tim Berners-Lee, the W3C and Google. That is why I won't point you to all the great web sites I have found and studied. Apart from that, many resources have disappeared over the years - breaking their own preachings. Below you can find my personal best-of URL design resources, which I think will preserve.</p>
